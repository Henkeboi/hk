Application architecture dictates how the application is structured over end systems. Examples are client-server and peer to peer(P2P)

A network application consists of pairs of processes that send messahes to each other over a network
A process sends messages into and receives messages from a software interface called socket
A socket is the interface between the application and transport layer
Socket or API - Application programming interface
Hosts are identified by IP and the process running on a host is identified by a port number
Sockets proggrammers can choose different transport protocols:
Reliable data transfer, throughput, timing and security
The available transport protocols are TCP and UDP
TCP: Reliable data transfer and connection oriented
TCP can be enhanced with SSL - Secure socket layer to encrypt messages
UDP: No-frills, lightweight transport protocol - unreliable and connectionless
An application layer protocol defines how an processes pass messages

HTTP - Hypertext transfer protocol is the Webs application layer protocol
HTTP is implemented in to programs - a client and a server program
HTTP uses TCP as its transport protocol
HTTP is stateless because an HTTP server doesnt maintain information about the clients
Uses presistent connections by standard
Non-presistent connection - Separate TCP connection for each request and response
A non-presisten TCP connection closes when the server has sendt the requested object
Presistent connection - One TCP connection for all requests and responses
HTTP can use both non-presistent and presitent connections
There are two typse of HTTP messages: Requests and responses
Many HTTP servers use cookies
A web cache or proxy server is a network entity that satisfies HTTP requests on behalf of the original server. 
A proxy server is both a server and a client
A conditional get allows proxy servers to stay updated at a low cost

Electronic mail
User agents are used to read and compose mail
User agents sends mail to the users mail server where the user has a mail box
The mail server sends the mail to the mailserver of the reciver, normally directly
SMTP is the application protocol of email - Simple mail transfer protocol
SMTP uses TCP
SMTP is old and only allows ASCII characters in the body of the email
SMTP is running as a client and server on every email server
By default uses port 25
SMPT uses a presistent connection
SMPT is a push protocol - the sending mail server pushes the file to the reciver
HTTP is a pull protocol - the users pulls information from a server at convenience
Therer are multiple mail access protocols: HTTP, Internet Mail Access Protocol and Post Office Protocol
POP3 is simple and limited: Authorization, ransaction and update
IMAP: More features than POP3 for example able to create folders at the server side. More complex
Using the browser as a client is possible with HTTP 

DNS - Domain name service
Hosts are identified by hostnames and IP addresses
THe DNS is a distributed database implemented in a hierarchy of DNS servers and a application layer protocol that allows host to query the distributed database
The DNS protocol runs over UDP and uses port 53
HTTP and SMTP use the client side of DNS to query a DNS server to obtain ip addresses
DNS provide host aliasing, mail server aliasing and load distribution
DNS has root, top level domain and authoritative servers
Every ISP has a local DNS server that acts as a proxy server
The queries from the requesting host to the local DNS are recursive if the local DNS doesnt have the requested mapping stored
The queries from the local DNS server to the DNS hierarchy is typically iterative

Peer to peer file distribution
BitTorrent is the most popular P2P file distribution protocol


Video streaming and content distribution networks
HTTP streaming is possible, but all clients get the same encoding of the video independen
t of download speeds
DASH - Dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP - allows different encodings depending on download speeds
CDN - Content distribution networks

Socket programming
Two types of network applicaitons: the apllication operations are specified in a protocol standard or the network application is proprietary
